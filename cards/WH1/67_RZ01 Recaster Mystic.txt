RZ01 Recaster Mystic	U	rare	Creature – Human Monk 	67	U	UU	FlashNEWLINEWhen Recaster Mystic enters the battlefield, target instant or sorcery spell you control gains rebound.

At the beginning of your next upkeep, you may cast it from exile without paying its mana cost.)     	2/1		normal	WH1		My thought process was "what if Snapcaster Mage but for rebound."
